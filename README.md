# MavisBot
Mavis (discord bot). Currently focusing on music, may branch to other features.

note: I do not recommend one to follow this project's structure - it is still very messy as I currently do not have time yet to clean up.

## To-do list for things in the future:
- Convert to TypeScript (I'm not a big fan of using weak-typed languages in bigger projects) **(Currently rewriting)**
- As a side effect of the first one, doing a huge clean up with the way things are placed and called is also within my list (some that is already within my radar is src/command/command.js (the way commands are managed), src/music/embed, and especially src/music/main.js. There's probably more, but I'll deal with that later) 
- and probably more things that I haven't thought of right now ...
